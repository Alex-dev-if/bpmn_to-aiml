Two Kinds of Chatbots

Chatbots are not new. However, utilization of the bots has attracted industries 
in the last few years. First established in the 1960s, chatbots have come a 
long way from its initial development. There are two types of chatbots. 
The most common kind of chatbot is rule-based, and the more advanced 
one is powered with artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots use natural language processing systems. 
In this system, computers are programmed to read, process, 
and analyze large quantities of natural language data. 
Artificial intelligence technologies also include deep learning 
and machine-learning algorithms. AI bots learn from the conversations 
and interactions they had with people, expanding their database.

On the other hand, rule-based bots are made of simple systems and,
 therefore, have limited responses. The system scans and determines 
 keywords form the user input and replies with the corresponding command. 
 Unlike the AI-based chatbots, rule-based chatbots no longer respond 
 when they encounter unfamiliar commands and unrecognized words.
